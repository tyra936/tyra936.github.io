  <p>Though our need to contact is innate, many of us frequently feel alone. Loneliness is the state of distress or discomfort that result when one perceives a gap between one's desire for social connection and actual experience if its. Even some people who are surrounded by others throughout the day or in a long lasting marriage still experience a deep and preceived loneliness. Research suggests that loneliness poses serious threats to well being as well as long-term physical health.  </p>
  <p>A number of unfavourable outcomes have been linked to loneliness. In addition to its associated with depressive  symptoms and other forms of mental illness, loneliness is a risk factor for heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and arthritis, among other disease. Lonely people are also twice as likely to develop such things as the increased production of stress hormones, hinder sleep, and result in weakened immunity.  </p>
  <p>Loneliness is as tied to the quality of one's relationship as it to the number of connections. And it doesnâ€™t only steam from heartache or isolation. A lack of authenticity in relationships can result in the feelings of loneliness. For some, not having a coveted animal companion, or the absence of a quiet presence in the home.</p>
